You made it through the incident. You’ve analyzed what happened,
and you’ve put in the time to document it. But will your
colleagues understand what you’ve written?</p>

<h2>Incident write-up editing</h2>


<p>If your readers struggle to understand the incident
from what you’ve written, then your efforts have been
wasted.</p>

<p>We work with you to transform your incident analysis
into a write-up that your colleagues will find compelling.</p>

<p>Using a narrative-based approach, we enable
your readers to make sense of the complex failure
that you want to explain to them.</p>
