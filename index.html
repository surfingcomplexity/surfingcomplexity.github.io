Surfing Complexity


Incidents grab your organization’s attention.
Your write-ups should too.


An incident just hit you. You’ve analyzed what happened,
and you’ve put in the time to document it. But will your
colleagues understand what you’ve written?

Consulting services


If your readers struggle to understand the incident
from what you’ve written, then your efforts have been
wasted.

We work with you to transform your incident analysis
into a write-up that your colleagues will find compelling.

Using a narrative-based approach, we enable
your readers to make sense of the complex failure
that you want to explain to them.
